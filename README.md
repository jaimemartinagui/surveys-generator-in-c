# Surveys-Generator-in-C

Surveys generator that selects from a text file a configurable number (at run time) of questions to produce the survey.
The answers to each question have only one of four predefined values.
It performs an indeterminate number of repetitions (asked to the user) of the same survey.
The survey questions are shuffled to include some randomness as they are entered in the source file, and the user will be able to add questions to the question file.
Finally, it provides some statistics of the number of responses to each question.
